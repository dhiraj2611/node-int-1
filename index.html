    Question 1 :what is Nodejs?<br>
    Nodejs is an open source,cross-platform,javaScript runtime environment built on v8 javaScript engine. It has following features which are metioned below:
    It is asynchronous in nature means when it receive another request it resolves it and make it available for for another request.
    It is event-driven and single-threaded which means server conatins a single thread i.e processed one after another.
    It has non-blocking properties like it does not block the execution process.<hr>
    Question 2 : What is NPM?<br>
    NPM stands for the node package manager which is used for node dependency management.
    NPM gets installed with NodeJs installation.
    NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code.
    Note:NPM uses Nested dependencies mean that any dependency is again dependent on another dependency.<hr>
    Question 3 : What are the modules in Node.js?<br>
    In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.
    Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.
    Modules are of three types:
    Core Modules/Internal modules:Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js installation. These modules can be loaded into the program by using the require function.
    Local Modules/Custom Modules:Local modules are created locally in your Node.js application, Means a modules that calculates various operations.
    Third-Party Modules:Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(NPM).These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally.<hr>
    Question 4 : What is the purpose of the module.exports?<br>
    Module.exports is the instruction that tells Node. js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to “export” from a given file so other files are allowed to access the exported code.
    By module.exports, we can export functions, objects, and their references from one file and can use them in other files by importing them by require() method.<hr>
    Question 5 : Difference between default export and named export?<br>
    Named Exports:
    <ul>
    Named exports are useful to export several values.
    Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file .
    Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the object, function or variable that was exported.
    During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.
    </ul>
    Default exports
    <ul>
    Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function, variable.
    During the import, we can use any name to import.<hr>
    </ul>
    
    Question 6 : How do you import any module in Node.js?<br>
    Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in the imported module in another file.
    The result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation. Example:const a = require('./func')<hr>
